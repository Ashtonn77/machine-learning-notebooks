## What is Machine Learning?
  Oliver Theobald:
  <blockquote>
  *Arthur Samuel* introduces machine learning in his paper as a subfield of
  computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being
  explicitly programmed.
  <br/>
  A key feature of machine learning is the concept of self-learning. This refers to the application of statistical modeling to detect patterns and improve performance based on data and empirical information, all without direct programming commands.
