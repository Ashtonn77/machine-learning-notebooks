## What is Machine Learning?
  Oliver Theobald:
  <blockquote>
  Arthur Samuel introduces machine learning in his paper as a subfield of
  computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being
  explicitly programmed. A key feature of machine learning is the concept of self-learning. This refers to the application of statistical modeling to detect           patterns and improve performance based on data and empirical information, all without direct programming commands.

## The three overshadowing categories of machine learning:
   1. Supervised Learning
   2. Unsupervised Learning
   3. Reinforcement Learning

*What are labels and features?*
  feature is input & label is output
    - feature: one column of the data in your input set. For instance, if you're trying to identify an object, your input features might include age, home region, family income, etc.
    - labels: the final choice, such as dog, fish, iguana, rock, etc.

### Supervised Learning
  As the first branch of machine learning, supervised learning concentrates on learning patterns through connecting the relationship between variables and known outcomes and working with labeled datasets. Supervised learning works by feeding the machine sample data with various features (represented as “X”) and the correct value output of the data(represented as “y”). The fact that the output and feature values are known qualifies the dataset as “labeled.” The algorithm then deciphers patterns that exist in the data and creates a model that can reproduce the same underlying rules with new data.
